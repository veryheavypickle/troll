This is a collection of unix shell scripts for trolling purposes

### fork_bomb_always
This script will only update the `.zshrc` file to include a fork bomb. Updating `.zshrc` means that upon opening a new terminal, the process will start.

This command can be shortened by removing the `cd &&` as this only guarantees that the file will be updated correctly.
